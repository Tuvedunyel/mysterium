# Mysterium

## Introduction

Will you dare to cross the threshold of the Mysterium Manor ?

A ghost haunts the manor. Mystery shrouds the circumstances of its death. Mediums gather
to reconstruct the events of the night of the crime. They cannot succeed without the help of the ghost, whose 
visions are the only clues to uncover the truth. Time is of the essence : at dawn, the ghost will fade away forever !
